// Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it.

//My Solution:

const square = arg => arg * arg;

//My Explanation:
//simply create a function using arrow syntax that has the parameter of arg and returns the product of multiplying arg times itself (returns the square)

//Tests:
square(3); //expected output: 9
square(12); //expected output: 144
square(5); //expected output: 25
